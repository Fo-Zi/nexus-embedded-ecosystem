# Nexus Embedded Ecosystem

*Contract-based and modular ecosystem for embedded development*

A multi-platform embedded firmware architecture built to address vendor lock-in and driver portability. This project explores hardware abstraction patterns that enable writing firmware once and deploying across different MCU platforms (ESP32, STM32, etc.) without code changes.

Started as an exploration of better abstraction patterns in embedded systems, it has evolved into a working ecosystem I use for my own projects. The architecture separates HAL interfaces from platform implementations, demonstrating practical approaches to modular firmware design.

**Project components**: HAL interface definitions, platform implementations (ESP32 IDF, STM32 bare-metal), hardware-agnostic drivers, and unified build tooling using West.

## üéØ What is it
The ecosystem separates hardware abstraction into independent, composable components:

- **HAL Interface** (`nexus-hal-interface`) - Platform-independent API definitions (the contracts)
- **Platform Implementations** (`nexus-hal-esp32-idf`, `nexus-llhal-stm32f103`) - Concrete implementations for specific platforms
- **Hardware Drivers** (`nexus-dht11`, `nexus-eeprom-24c32`) - Drivers built against the interface, not specific platforms
- **Build Tooling** - Unified commands across different build systems and platforms

This separation emerged from experimenting with different abstraction patterns‚Äîwhat started as a simple HAL shim evolved into a multi-repository architecture that balances flexibility with practical constraints.

### Quick Simple Example
```c
// This BME280 driver works on ESP32, STM32, etc:
#include "nhal_i2c_master.h"  // ‚Üê Only depends on interface

static const uint8_t BME280_REG_TEMP_MSB = 0xFA; // ‚Üê Defined at some bme280_reg_defs.h or similar

bme280_result_t bme280_read_temp(bme280_handle_t *sensor, float *temp) {
    uint8_t data[3];
    nhal_result_t result = nhal_i2c_master_write_read_reg(
        sensor->i2c_ctx,     // ‚Üê NHAL I2C Context you provide
        sensor->dev_addr,    // ‚Üê I2C device address (some devices allow setting it via hardware pins)
        &BME280_REG_TEMP_MSB, 1
        data, sizeof(data)
    );

    // Process data...
    return BME280_OK;
}
```

No platform #ifdefs, no vendor-specific APIs. The driver is portable by design.

## üí≠ Motivation and Goals

### üîç Motivation

Working across different embedded platforms, I kept hitting the same issues:

**Testability**: Vendor HALs aren't designed for unit testing. I'd write abstraction shims for every project just to test drivers in isolation‚Äîa pattern I was repeating too often.

**Driver portability**: Each I2C device driver expected different function signatures. Ten devices meant ten different integration patterns. There was no common contract.

**Platform lock-in**: Switching from ESP-IDF to bare-metal STM32 meant rewriting not just peripheral code, but drivers too. RTOS-based HALs and bare-metal HALs looked completely different, even though most drivers need the same basic operations.

**Unnecessary complexity**: Some HAL layers are heavyweight for simple use cases. I wanted something modular‚Äîuse what you need, skip what you don't.

These problems became the design constraints for this project.

### üéØ Goals

**Platform-independent driver development**: Drivers depend on interface contracts, not platform specifics. Write a sensor driver once, use it across ESP32, STM32, or any platform with a HAL implementation.

**Implementation flexibility**: The interface defines behavior, not implementation details. Platform implementations can optimize for RTOS vs bare-metal, performance vs memory, or specific hardware features‚Äîwhatever fits the target constraints.

**Allocation agnostic**: No forced allocation patterns. Implementations and applications choose static or dynamic allocation based on their needs.

**Extensibility**: Leave room for platform-specific features through implementation config structures. Not every platform supports every feature, and the interface acknowledges that.

These goals guide the design, though the specifics continue to evolve based on what works in practice.

‚Üí [Core design principles & contracts](docs/architecture/core-principles.md)

---

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The architecture evolved through iteration, settling on a structure that separates contracts from implementations:

```
Your Application
    ‚Üì
Nexus Drivers (BME280, DS3231, etc.) ‚Üê Only depend on interface
    ‚Üì
nexus-hal-interface ‚Üê Contract definitions (header-only)
    ‚Üì
nexus-hal-esp32 / nexus-hal-stm32 ‚Üê Platform implementations
```

**Design principles**:

**Contract-based dependencies**: Drivers and application code depend on interface contracts, not concrete implementations. This inverts the typical dependency direction‚Äîplatforms implement interfaces rather than applications depending on platform APIs.

**Implementation freedom**: The interface defines behavior, not mechanisms. Implementations choose their own synchronization primitives (mutexes, critical sections, lock-free), memory strategies, and optimizations based on platform constraints.

**Explicit ownership**: Applications allocate and own all context structures. The HAL initializes memory you provide‚Äîno hidden allocations, no lifecycle ambiguity.

**Platform integration**: Hardware-specific code (pin mappings, clock configuration, startup) lives in a platform layer outside the ecosystem. The [showcase project](https://github.com/Fo-Zi/nexus-showcase-project) demonstrates this pattern.

This structure emerged from trying several approaches‚Äîmonolithic HALs, plugin systems, compile-time polymorphism‚Äîand finding what balanced flexibility with practical constraints.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow & Tooling

A multi-repository architecture needs consistent tooling across different platforms and build systems. The ecosystem should provide unified commands for building, flashing, and managing dependencies regardless of whether you're working with ESP-IDF, bare-metal CMake, or other build systems.

### Unified Build System

After evaluating options (Git submodules, CMake FetchContent, Bazel), I chose [West](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/west/index.html)‚ÄîZephyr's meta-tool‚Äîbecause it handles multi-repo versioning, detects version conflicts automatically, supports custom commands, and provides extensible flash runners.

The custom commands live in [`nexus-hal-interface`](https://github.com/Fo-Zi/nexus-hal-interface)‚Äîthe common dependency across all ecosystem projects. This centralizes tooling while keeping individual components independent.

**Example workflow**:

```bash
# Build for specific platform
west build -b esp32
west build -b stm32f103

# Flash to device
west flash

# Clean build artifacts
west clean

# List all available projects
west list-projects
```

**What this provides:**
- **Automatic project detection** - Supports ESP-IDF, CMake, and Make projects
- **Extensible flash runners** - OpenOCD, ST-Link, ESP-IDF tools, custom runners
- **Cross-platform consistency** - Same commands across STM32, ESP32, and other targets
- **Dependency version enforcement** - Catches incompatible dependency versions early

The tooling abstracts platform differences while preserving access to platform-specific optimizations when needed.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges & Tradeoffs

Building this ecosystem surfaced several practical challenges and design tradeoffs:

**Not a complete SDK**: This is an abstraction layer, not a full SDK. Development workflows still depend on the underlying platform‚ÄîESP-IDF projects use `idf.py` tooling, bare-metal STM32 needs OpenOCD and linker scripts. West unifies commands where possible, but platform-specific details remain.

**IDE integration**: No plug-and-play IDE extensions. I use `compile_commands.json` with clangd for code completion‚Äîmanual but functional. A guide for this setup is planned.

**Genericity vs. implementation complexity**: The core tension. Example: DHT11 needs a pin configured as both input and output with pull-up support. If the interface exposes pull-up configuration, the driver works‚Äîbut only if the implementation supports it. Silent failures happen when a pin doesn't support the required feature. The alternative (exposing full hardware capabilities) makes implementations complex.

Current approach: Keep interfaces minimal and let platform integration layers handle hardware-specific validation. Not perfect, but pragmatic.

**Abstraction overhead**: Every abstraction adds a layer of indirection. For performance-critical code, implementations can bypass the interface and use platform APIs directly. The ecosystem doesn't forbid mixing abstraction levels‚Äîuse what fits the constraint.

These tradeoffs are inherent to hardware abstraction. The goal is finding a balance that works for most use cases while acknowledging the edge cases.

## üîÑ Closing Thoughts

This project represents my exploration of embedded systems architecture‚Äîhow to build firmware that's portable without sacrificing control, modular without adding excessive complexity.

Each component taught me something: ESP-IDF implementation about framework integration patterns, bare-metal STM32 about register-level programming, drivers about API usability, and the showcase project about bringing it all together into a cohesive system.

The ecosystem is functional and I use it for my own projects, but it's still evolving. Interfaces will continue to change as I discover better patterns. That's deliberate‚ÄîI'm iterating toward something that works well in practice, not rushing to a v1.0.0 before the design is validated.

This work demonstrates my approach to systems design: identify real problems, experiment with solutions, make informed tradeoffs, and iterate based on what works. It's as much about the process as the result.
