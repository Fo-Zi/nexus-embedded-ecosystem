# Nexus Embedded Ecosystem

*Contract-based and modular Ecosystem for Embedded Development*

---

## 🎯 What is it
I call it "Ecosystem", because it started merely as a shim HAL but quickly mutated to be more than that. 
This project is composed by the following independent components:
- **Hardware Interface** (`nexus-hal-interface`) → An isolated repo ; Only contains platform-independent interfaces ('the contracts')
- **Platform Implementation** ( i.e.: `nexus-hal-esp32-idf`, `nexus-hal-cmsis`, etc ) → Isolated repos ; Each constitutes an implementation for the `nexus-hal-interface`
- **Drivers** (i.e.: `nexus-eeprom-24c32`) → Drivers built on top of **the interface** ; 
- **Complementary tooling** (i.e.: `nexus-ci`) → Other components that ease the development workflow ;

### Quick Simple Example
```c
// This BME280 driver works on ESP32, STM32, etc:
#include "nhal_i2c_master.h"  // ← Only depends on interface

static const uint8_t BME280_REG_TEMP_MSB = 0xFA; // ← Defined at some bme280_reg_defs.h or similar

bme280_result_t bme280_read_temp(bme280_handle_t *sensor, float *temp) {
    uint8_t data[3];
    nhal_result_t result = nhal_i2c_master_write_read_reg(
        sensor->i2c_ctx,     // ← NHAL I2C Context you provide
        sensor->dev_addr,    // ← I2C device address (some devices allow setting it via hardware pins)
        &BME280_REG_TEMP_MSB, 1
        data, sizeof(data)
    );

    // Process data...
    return BME280_OK;
}
```

No platform #ifdefs, no vendor-specific APIs.

## 💭 Motivation and Goals

### 🔍 Motivation

While working with Embedded Systems I have faced some pain-points:

- **🧪 Vendor HALs and others are not usually designed with testability in mind**
  - I have found myself writing shim layers of abstraction for peripherals in order to be able to unit-test some complex driver or component
    (You can of course do it, but I found myself repeating this common step many times)

- **🔌 Drivers were not designed around a common interface**
  - If the driver uses something like dependency injection, for example for the hardware functionality it needs, you'd often find yourself having to duplicate a ton of code. Imagine having ten I2C devices, whose drivers all use dependency injection with different function signatures..

- **🔒 The HAL your code depends on, is tied to a specific Framework/MCU/SDK**
  - This goes hand-by-hand with the first point
  - The porting efforts become bigger → Your code and your drivers need some degree of refactoring
  - Usually I have found also that HALs for RTOSes are radically different from HALs for Bare Metal. While this has of course good reasons to be like that, I often found that most drivers depend on the same functionality, what changes could be if you need to take a mutex before accessing a shared bus as a master or not (for example), or some other implementation specific detail.

- **🏗️ Some HALs are very complex and big**
  - For some projects these HALs are an overkill, even if more generic than others

All of these points and probably others that I am missing, pushed me to create this project and experiment with it.

### 🎯 Goals

- **Provide platform-independent interfaces that drivers can depend on**
  - Drivers only depend on the nexus-hal-interface, and are transparent to platform-details.
- **Not to force a specific Implementation of the HAL interface**
  - I will provide basic implementations for me to test the approach on a few platforms. You can use those, or
    provide your own implementations with the focus you need (performance, memory footprint, power consumption, etc)
  - This way, you can prototype using a common interface, and if you later need to optimize its implementation, you can.
- **To design the contracts as 'allocation free'**
  - The HAL implementation and consumer determine the allocation scheme. You may want to use a static or dynamic approach, that's up to you. 
- **To leave room for extension and implementation specific details**
  - It's not possible to create config/context structures that are applicable **anywhere**, there is always some niche case that you haven't considered.

## 🏛️ Architecture

The ecosystem separates the **what** from the **how**:

```
Your Application
    ↓
Nexus Drivers (BME280, DS3231, etc.) ← Only depend on interface
    ↓  
nexus-hal-interface ← Contract definitions (header-only)
    ↓
nexus-hal-esp32 / nexus-hal-stm32 ← Platform implementations
```

**Key principles**:
- **Contract-based**: Drivers depend on interface contracts, not implementations
- **Implementation freedom**: 
  - The interface doesn't force allocation patterns. Implementations can use mutexes, static locks, interrupt disabling, or pools - whatever fits their platform and your needs.
  - Each platform can optimize for its needs (RTOS vs bare metal, performance vs size, etc.)
- **Context ownership**: You own and manage all contexts and configuration structures - HAL **initializes** your memory, doesn't allocate it for you

**Platform Integration Layer**: 
- This is your hardware-specific glue code - pin assignments, clock configs, etc.
- Not part of the Ecosystem, since it cannot be defined generically. But examples and templates will be provided that help to
  isolate: platform-specific vs platform-agnostic (🗓️ Planned)

## ⚠️ Challenges

So far I have identified the following challenges, that I will be experimenting on different ways to address them:

- **🛠️ This is not "an SDK"** - While the architecture offers some interesting advantages, it's far from "an SDK". This means that the development workflow depends for now heavily on what hal-implementation you are using. For example:
  - If using `nexus-hal-esp32-idf`, you will have access to idf tooling, allowing you to flash and debug using Python-based scripting
  - If using `nexus-hal-cmsis`, you will have to delve more into low level details to flash and debug your device, likely reusing some linker script and openocd config file.

- **🖥️ IDE integration is manual**
  - If you want to use a full IDE to develop Software through this ecosystem, you will not have an extension to install everything nor make your IDE recognize all dependencies.
    I personally just instruct CMake to export the build commands in a JSON format to a location I know of, and then create a `.clangd` file indicating where it should find it. This works at least with VS code, Zed editor, and most Vim/Nvim setups. (You would still need to personalize your IDE interaction if you want to build/flash/debug using only GUI) → I will add a guide on how to do this later on

- **⚖️ Design trade-offs** - There's a clear tension and trade-off relationship between some design choices:
  - **Portability** vs **Easiness of use**
  - **Easiness of adding support for new MCUs/HAL impl./etc** vs **Tooling complexity and abstraction**
  - **Standardizing build/flash/debug ops among different hal implementations** vs **Freedom of customization**

a low level implementation

#### 3.1 Bare-Metal Implementation 🗓️ *Planned*
- [ ] **`nexus-hal-stm32f407vg`** (or similar popular MCU)
  - Register-level implementation (No external HALs, no framework)
  - Basic necessary complementary tooling to build/flash/debug:
    - Linker scripts
    - OpenOCD configuration
    - Startup code
    - CMake integration with flash/debug targets

#### 3.2 Passive Buzz (PWM) Driver 🗓️ *Planned*
- [ ] **`nexus-006ky`** 
  - This will depend on `PWM interface`, which will need to be implemented on `nexus-hal-interface`
  - An implementation of `PWM interface` needs then to be developed
  - Then the driver can be tested both through software and hardware

### Phase 4: Framework Adapter HAL Implementation 🗓️ *Planned*

**Goal**: Support an MCU through CMSIS, and design a scalable approach to ease and facilitate adding support for new MCUs already supported in the framework

#### 4.1 CMSIS Framework Adapter  
- [ ] **`nexus-hal-cmsis-core`**
  - Support at least one MCU through [CMSIS core](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_5/Core/html/index.html)
  - Create a template system to facilitate adding support for new MCUs

#### 4.2 Photoresistor (ADC) Driver 🗓️ *Planned*
- [ ] **`nexus-018ky`** 
  - This will depend on `ADC interface`, which will need to be implemented on `nexus-hal-interface`
  - An implementation of `ADC interface` needs then to be developed
  - Then the driver can be tested both through software and hardware

### Phase 5: Portable Project, Documentation and First stable release 🗓️ *Planned* 

**Goal**: To create a project based on the Ecosystem, showing the Platform Integration Layer, SOLID principles, and
how to build the project for different supported platforms ; To document the approach and patterns used ; To release the first
stable version of the HAL Interface!

#### 5.1 Showcase Project 🗓️ *Planned*
- [ ] **`nexus-showcase-project`**
  - A project that showcases how the Ecosystem was envisioned
  - To provide easy-to-use commands to compile and change the target platform
  - To apply SOLID principles throughout the project, and how they fit with the ecosystem
  - To use a modern approach, with CI,automated testing,automated doc, etc

#### 5.2 Documentation 🏗️ *In progress*
- [ ] **`nexus-embedded-ecosystem`**
  - General Documentation:
      - Architecture
      - Design decisions and tradeoffs
      - Basic Guides
  - To document the Showcase Project and Patterns used

#### 5.3 🚀 First Stable Version Release v1.0.0 🗓️ *Planned*
- [ ] **`nexus-hal-interface` v1.0.0**
  - At this point, there should be enough experimentation to be
    able to release the first stable version.
  - Does it mean that the interface will not evolve since this point?
    No. It means:
    - Core interfaces have been tested and will likely not be modified.
    - Advanced or more specific interfaces can be designed and added, as long as
      they don't break other components (CI will be in place for this)
    

### Optional Advanced Features 🔮 *Future*
  
#### Display Driver (ST7789 TFT) 🔮 *Future*
- [ ] **`nexus-st7789`**
  - Implement the driver, depending exclusively on the `nexus-hal-interface`
  - Implement basic unit-tests for it, to validate the driver and mocks of the interface
  - Analyze how comfortable is the `SPI interface` to use
    
#### Power Management Interface 🔮 *Future*
- [ ] **`nexus-hal-interface`**
  - Power management is usually HIGHLY dependant on the platform, but in practice, usually not more
    than 3-4 power modes are used (Like for example: normal, light-sleep, deep-sleep, stand-by ).
  - An interesting idea would be to abstract these modes, and to provide some way for the
    Platform Integration Layer to decide on "the how" (i.e. what set of peripherals,clocks, and interrupts are
    enabled/disabled for each)

#### Modern C++ Approach 🔮 *Future*
- [ ] **`nexus-hal-interface-cpp`,`nexus-hal-***-cpp`**
  - To create a pure modern C++ interface version of the NHAL. Using features like: Namespaces ,Templates,
    template specialization, concepts, constexpr, variants, optionals, etc. 
  - Compile-time code generation and metaprogramming would be a great fit for frameworks that
    need to be generic/well abstracted, while not losing efficiency in the process.
  - The Platform Integration Layer could be implemented in a much cleaner way using this approach. Even
    with some code generation
    

## 🔄 Last words

This is a work in progress. The interfaces will change, and I'll probably discover better approaches as I build more drivers and support more platforms. But that's the point - to experiment and learn what actually works in practice.

I will iterate until I find something that feels comfortable to work with, until that point, versioning will move fast. And once I get a stable enough API, I will release the first stable v1.0.0
